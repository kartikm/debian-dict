Definition:
 DD, or Debian Developer, is a status in the Debian project that allows the
 member full rights granted by the constitution, which includes the right to
 vote in GRs and DPL elections, or propose GRs.
 .
 DDs are also granted ssh rights into porterboxen, as well as project machines,
 as well as a subscription to debian-private, the premiere list for vacation
 notices.
 .
 There are two major types of DDs, Non-Uploading DDs and Uploading DDs. This
 just denotes if the member is able to upload or sponsor uploads to the archive.
 .
 DDs can be spoted in the wild by a @debian.org email address, or a freenode
 cloak of "debian/developer/name" (where name is their uid / account).
