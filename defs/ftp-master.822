Definition:
 ftp-master may refer to the server (ftp-master.debian.org, the home of the
 FTP team), or the person(s) in charge of the ftp team.
 .
 The server is where one usually uploads packages to the archive (but be aware
 there are other queues in other places, such as ssh.upload.debian.org), and
 the canonical copy of the archive lives.
 .
 The person(s) "ftp-master(s)" are the folks who manage the NEW queue (where
 all new packages go), as well as BYHAND packages, where they check (very
 briefly, this is only a sanity check) for common mistakes, license issues,
 and no major violations of policy.
 .
 You can thank your friendly ftp team at <ftpmaster@debian.org>, or stop
 by their IRC room at #debian-ftp on irc.oftc.net.
