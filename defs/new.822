Definition:
 The NEW queue is the place where all new packages (to Debian) go to sit
 before they enter the archive.
 .
 The NEW processing is needed to:
 .
   - Try to keep the archive Legal and DFSG free
   - Try to keep the package namespace sane
   - Try to keep the number of bugs down.
 .
 As seen in the REJECT FAQ (http://ftp-master.debian.org/REJECT-FAQ.html),
 some of the things a package will get REJECTed for are:
 .
   - Non-DFSG free license
   - Linking against OpenSSL when it's not legal to do so
   - Bad copyright file
   - Binary blobs / sourceless bits
   - FTBFSIASW
