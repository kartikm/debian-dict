Definition:
 dak, or Debian Archive Kit, is the core software that runs the Debin archive.
 It's what apt (and friends) speak to, and it's what manages the NEW queue.
 .
 dak runs on PostgreSQL, and is hosted on <ftp-master.debian.org>, currently
 pointing at <franck.debian.org>, with a DD mirror on <release.debian.org>,
 which is currently pointing at <ries.debian.org>.
 .
 You can access dak's database (projectb) on either of those servers, but
 please don't poke around ftp-master without the ftp-masters knowing.
 .
 You can check out the source at <http://ftp-master.debian.org/git/dak.git>,
 and get it running by following the README.
