Definition:
 FTBFS, or Failure to Build from Source, is a common abbreviation, commonly
 found when someone tries to rebuild a package using a more up-to-date chroot
 than was used to build the package last.
 .
 This is commonly a result of depending on deprecated / changed behavior, such
 as a compiler upgrade or API change.
 .
 It's also often seen in bug reports automatically filed by watchful Developers
 or the automated build infrastructure.
